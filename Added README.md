# NGO Programme Impact Dashboard

This project simulates the data tracking and reporting system of a youth empowerment NGO in South Africa. It includes:

✅ Cleaned data in CSV  
✅ A visual dashboard built in Power BI  
✅ A written report summarizing the findings (partially AI-assisted)  
✅ Optional Python notebook for data cleaning  

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
- Python (Pandas)
- ChatGPT (for report assistance)

## Purpose
To demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and AI-assisted reporting in the context of programme evaluation.

## Sample Insights
- 72% of participants completed the course
- 48% found employment within 3 months
- Highest success rates in Gauteng and KZN

## Next Steps
- Add predictive modeling (e.g., who is likely to drop out?)
- Integrate dashboard with real-time updates
